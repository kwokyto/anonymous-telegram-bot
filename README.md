# Anonymous by Love, USP

![anonymous logo](anonymous_profile_pic.jpg)

Anonymous was created to create a safe space for USP students to hold meaningful conversations about mental health.
This simulates a group chat where students can share experience or advice, while remaining completely anonymous.
The telegram bot can be accessed [here](https://telegram.me/anongroupbetabot).

:warning: This bot was disabled as of 17 April 2021. Contact @kwokyto on Telegram for any enquiries.

## Features

When registered, any message that you sent to the bot will be sent to all other students that are also registered on the bot.
Your message would be accompanied by your username, allowing others to identify messages that are sent.
No other personal information would be shared with anyone in the group.

## General Commands

Below are a list of available commands for users that can be used in the Telegram bot.

### `/start`

Returns a general welcome message.

### `/about`

Returns a bot description, along with the sign up link, FAQ link, and adminsâ€™ Telegram handles.

### `/register <NUSNET ID> <password>`

Registers the student into the Anonymous system.
After being registered, students can send and receive messages.
The password is specific to each student, and will be provided by Love, USP admin.

### `/username`

Shows the student's username.

### `/leave`

Unregisters the student from the Anonymous system.
Afterwards, students will no longer be able to receive messages that are sent.
All details of the student that are stored in the Anonymous system would also be deleted.

## Admin Commands

These commands should only be made known to the admin to prevent misuse.

### `/delete <NUSNET ID> <password>`

Unregisters the user with a certain NUSNET ID.
This is to ensure that admins can easily remove any user that may be causing distress in the chat.
The password used here is different from the password used in `/register`, and should only be known by the admin.
